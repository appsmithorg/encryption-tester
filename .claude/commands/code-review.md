Review the current codebase for quality, security, and maintainability.

Focus areas:
- Encryption best practices (algorithm choice, key handling, salt generation)
- Input validation and error handling
- Swing UI thread safety (EDT usage)
- Code structure and separation of concerns

Categorize findings as:
- **Critical**: Must fix (security vulnerabilities, data loss risks)
- **Warning**: Should fix (potential bugs, bad practices)
- **Suggestion**: Nice to have (readability, performance)
